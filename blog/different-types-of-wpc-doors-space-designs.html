         <h1 class="mb-4">Different Types of WPC Doors – Space Designs</h1>
         <p>When it comes to choosing the right doors for your home or office, WPC (Wood Plastic Composite) doors have emerged as a popular and versatile option. WPC doors are manufactured by combining wood fibers or sawdust with thermoplastic polymers, resulting in a durable and aesthetically pleasing material. In this article, we will explore into the different types of WPC doors available in the market, addressing commonly asked questions along the way.</p>

         <h2 class="mt-4">What are WPC Doors?</h2>
         <p>WPC doors are a type of composite doors made from a blend of wood fibers or sawdust and thermoplastic polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP). This combination of materials results in a door that possesses the natural look and feel of wood while also benefiting from the strength and durability of plastic. WPC doors are known for their resistance to moisture, termites, and decay, making them an excellent choice for various applications.</p>

         <h2 class="mt-4">Types of WPC Doors:</h2>
         <ul>
           <li><strong>Solid WPC Doors:</strong> Solid WPC doors are made entirely of WPC material, offering excellent strength, stability, and durability. These doors are suitable for both interior and exterior applications and are available in various designs and finishes to complement different architectural styles.</li>
           <li><strong>WPC Flush Doors:</strong> WPC flush doors consist of a WPC sheet laminated over a core material, usually made of honeycomb paper or particleboard. These doors are lightweight and offer good dimensional stability. They are commonly used for interior applications such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and offices.</li>
           <li><strong>WPC Panel Doors:</strong> WPC panel doors are characterized by the incorporation of decorative panels made of WPC material. These panels can be solid or hollow, and they add visual interest and aesthetic appeal to the doors. WPC panel doors are commonly used for main entrances, as they provide an elegant and stylish look.</li>
           <li><strong>WPC Glass Doors:</strong> WPC glass doors feature the integration of glass panels within the WPC framework. These doors allow natural light to penetrate through while maintaining privacy. WPC glass doors are often used in spaces where transparency and visual connectivity are desired, such as offices and commercial establishments.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2 class="mt-4">Which WPC is best?</h2>
         <p>The best type of WPC for doors depends on various factors such as application, budget, and personal preference. Different WPC compositions, including PVC, PE, and PP, offer varying levels of performance and characteristics. PVC-based WPC is commonly considered the best choice for doors due to its excellent durability, moisture resistance, and dimensional stability.</p>

         <h2 class="mt-4">Which is costly: WPC or UPVC?</h2>
         <p>When comparing costs, WPC doors are generally more expensive than UPVC (Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) doors. WPC doors are made from a composite material that combines wood fibers or sawdust with thermoplastic polymers, while UPVC doors are made solely from rigid PVC. The additional cost of wood fibers or sawdust in the WPC manufacturing process contributes to its higher price compared to UPVC doors.</p>

         <h2 class="mt-4">Which is cheaper: PVC or WPC?</h2>
         <p>In terms of cost, PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) doors are generally cheaper than WPC doors. PVC doors are made entirely from rigid PVC, while WPC doors consist of a blend of wood fibers or sawdust and PVC. The addition of wood fibers or sawdust in the WPC composition increases its cost, making it relatively more expensive compared to PVC doors.</p>

         <h2 class="mt-4">WPC Door Suppliers in Hyderabad</h2>
         <p>WPC doors offer a wide range of options to suit different needs and preferences. Solid WPC doors, WPC flush doors, WPC panel doors, and WPC glass doors are some of the popular choices available in the market.</p>
